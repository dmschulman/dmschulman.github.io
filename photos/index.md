The art of photography has always fascinated, the ability to capture light is akin to freezing time iself. I received my first digital camera at the age of 16, a [Canon Powershot A40](https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A40/A40A.HTM) packed to the gills with 2 megapixels. Digital photography has come a long way since then, even the camera on my mobile phone has 10x the power of that old point-and-shoot, but the thrill of capturing a perfectly composed image never leaves, no matter how fantastic or dated your technology is. The galleries below comprise much of my personal photography work, please enjoy.

You can also find a lot of my photos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dmschulman) these days.
