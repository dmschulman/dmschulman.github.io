A little experiment. Six Link Saturday will be a regular installment (hopefully every Saturday, or else the name will start to sound silly) of 6 interesting, astounding, or otherwise relevant internet items, hand-picked by yours truly. Served chilled.

The six links of Six Link Saturday will all be unique, six different websites about six different topics concerning six different circumstances you probably haven't even heard about yet. Oh, and one picture of my choosing will also be provided (is 'Six Link Saturday And Also One Picture’ a catchy title?).
