Australian comedy duo Clark and Dawe tackle the topic of our current recession in the United States, explaining to the audience how the crisis began, how much damage it might actually do, and what these developments mean for international markets. Ironically, these guys have done a better job summing up the situation than I believe most American news analysts.
