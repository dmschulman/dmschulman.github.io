Well, I loved Feisty, but I don't think upgrading to Gutsy just yet was the best idea. No dual monitors, no full screen video, no ATI love, and a lot of bugged out packages. I’m sure things will improve as time goes on, but for now, I’m changing my system over to Windows Vista.

I figure the worst that can happen is I get everything working properly, save the disk image, and use VirtualBox to emulate Vista on a fresh Feisty install sometime in the future, but for now things seem to be running pretty well on my new Windows system. Still no support for my Thinkpad's graphics card, and only one monitor is working at the moment, but hopefully that will change in time.

In the meanwhile, pardon the silence as I get things up and running.
