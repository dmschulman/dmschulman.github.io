Well, the US housing market is currently collapsing faster than Gov. Eliot Spitzers career, but apparently there is a thin silver lining amidst all this lending turmoil in the form of historic architecturally-significant buildings suddenly becoming affordable to all of us five-figure making schlubs. While the banks scramble to save their butts and low-interest rates remain in the air, many previous unfordable historic properties have now hit a rock bottom low (California and Nevada especially) and are waiting to be snatched up.

This small Keck & Keck house in Chicago Heights, a property that would easily fetch over $1 million, was recently purchased for a mere $213,000 thanks to the tumbling markets and some keen craigslisting. An even more impressive Frank Lloyd Wright (well, Wright himself didn't design it, but itâ€™s still impressive) Prairie style house just went for $585,000 in Los Angeles, an already ultra-inflated housing market. This trend is probably [going to get worse](http://www.businessweek.com/common_ssi/map_of_misery.htm) before it gets any better, but consider this economic downturn as a time to make some wise investments.
