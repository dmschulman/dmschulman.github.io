Areas where I have achieved:

1. Ethernet is working

2. Sound works

3. X server is working (kind of)

4. Bluetooth support

5. Hibernation/Sleep mode working

Areas where I have yet to achieve:

1. Wireless internet

2. Printing support

3. Infrared support

4. Audio recording and JACK

5. LAMP server

6. Get X working with DRI

7. Read network and use SMB shares

It's hard being an achiever.
