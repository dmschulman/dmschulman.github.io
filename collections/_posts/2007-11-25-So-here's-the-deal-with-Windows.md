Well, within 30 minutes of installing Windows Vista on my laptop I've managed to somehow contract four viruses and six malwares that love to tell me about offers for FREE C14lis. After slapping myself in the face a few times for sheepishly giving Windows another go, I wiped my system and reinstalled Ubuntu.

Then I had a long restful Thanksgiving break.

And now I'm back online! Well, for the most part. Iâ€™m still chugging along with this web design, trying to make this site look good across multiple browsers (god damn you Internet Explorer). Expect further updates soon.
