title: "Shruthi XT SMR4 First Noodle"
artist: "Porter Vance"
description: "This demo is just a noodle of the XT control surface and SMR-4 filter. I tried to capture some of the squelchy and fat characteristics of this particular board. I plan on using a 4PM filter eventually in the XT, just have to build it first! The sound is straight from the output of the Shruthi into my MOTU interface. The Shruthi is being sequenced by a MIDI-enabled KORG Monotribe. Enjoy!"
