[Nedroid](http://www.nedroid.com/) is one of those rare comics on the internet that readers can appreciate for both its sense of humor and appealingly unique style. Strips are non-sequitur, usually involving karate or robots (sometimes bacon), but many sequences tend to follow the deadly duo of Reginald, a little birdy guy, and Beartato, a little furry guy. Other work by Nedroid includes the response to a challenge posed by a reader to draw [200 bad comics](http://nedroid.com/bcpage1.html), and a slew of short series, prints, sketches, and other b-sides in the [archive](http://nedroid.com/archive.html), plenty of material to pore over.
