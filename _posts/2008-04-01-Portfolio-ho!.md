The lack of new updates recently has been due to two things. One is the extraordinary amount of homework I've been undertaking recently (I am about to graduate from college after all), not to mention the documentary I’m working on at the moment, and additionally, I’ve been putting work into the less loved parts of this great website (namely my Portfolio section). Updates will resume as scheduled once I get a few more things out of the way.

In the meanwhile, check out some of the amazing work I've done over the years!

More to follow. Keep your eyes peeled.
