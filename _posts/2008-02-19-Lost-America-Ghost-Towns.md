In what I'm assuming is a side project of Design Sheds founder [Troy Paiva](http://www.designshed.com/), Lost America is a retro slice of the middle of the country containing desolate and abandoned pieces of Americaâ€™s past. The past, in this case, is otherwise defined as a time from the 1950s until the mid 1970s, when everyone drove a Cadillac and people wore hats to work.
