Yup, getting up to date here with some new looks. I will be adding more to the sidebar and the header in the next day or two (hopefully I can also get my other pages working too). After that, I plan to get my comments form functioning properly, maybe add a theme switcher or two, and then rock out on some new blog posts (hopefully). I'm anxious to get my portfolio up here. Still searching for the proper Wordpress plugins to display the content though. It needs to integrate well and shouldnâ€™t be a cheap-feeling piece of Flash crap.

Plans also include adding a projects section and a photostream gallery, just to name a few improvements. I should also test posting an image or two while I'm at it.
