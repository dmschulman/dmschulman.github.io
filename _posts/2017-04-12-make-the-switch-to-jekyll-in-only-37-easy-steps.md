Today marks this site's official switch over from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), a CMS I've utilized for almost 12 years, to a more light-weight and agile platform, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I'm looking forward to a long a fruitful relationship with something a little leaner and meaner than Wordpress, and hosting things on a personal Github repository via Github Pages is a welcomed solution, but I'll be damned if getting things off the ground wasn't the slightest bit confusing and frustruating.

For you see, almost [every](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) [available](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) [for](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) [setting](http://www.stephaniehicks.com/githubPages_tutorial/pages/githubpages-jekyll.html) [up](http://anandmanisankar.com/posts/set-up-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) Github Pages with Jekyll also acts as a supplimental lesson in how to get started with Git and initialize/synchronize your first Github project. This is great if you're brand new to the concept of version control and want to get up and running quickly with a Jekyll site on Github Pages, the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) repo helps make this easy for most users, but these guides, in my experience, are only worth your time if your end goal is to build a local Jekyll install where everything on your site is accomplished via Jekyll and all work is handled on that one instance.

Being among 5 computer at any given time and hoping to do more with my Github Pages than run a simple Jekyll site, the above was not my use case.
