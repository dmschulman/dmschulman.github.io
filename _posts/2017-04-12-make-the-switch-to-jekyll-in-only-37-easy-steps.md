Today marks this site's official switch over from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), a CMS I've utilized for almost 12 years, to a more light-weight and agile platform, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I'm looking forward to a long a fruitful relationship with something a little leaner and meaner than Wordpress, and hosting things on a personal Github repository via Github Pages is a welcomed solution, but I'll be damned if getting things off the ground wasn't the slightest bit confusing and frustruating.

For you see, almost [every](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) [available](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) [for](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) [setting](http://www.stephaniehicks.com/githubPages_tutorial/pages/githubpages-jekyll.html) [up](http://anandmanisankar.com/posts/set-up-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) Github Pages with Jekyll also acts as a supplimental lesson in how to get started with Git and initialize/synchronize your first Github project. This is great if you're brand new to the concept of version control and want to get up and running quickly with a Jekyll site on Github Pages, the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) repo helps make this easy for most users, but these guides, in my experience, are only worth your time if your end goal is to build a local Jekyll install where everything on your site is accomplished via Jekyll and all work is handled on that one local instance (syncing with Github of course to publish your site live on the internet).

Being among 5 computer at any given time and hoping to do more with my Github Pages than run a simple Jekyll site, the above was not my use case. As you can probably tell from my recent Github history, I made many attempts at getting a Jekyll site up and running via Github Pages, approaching each install from a slightly different angle (initializing my repo locally, initializing my repo on Github, not branching gh-pages, branching gh-pages, throwing my laptop across the room, not throwing my laptop across the room). The overall theme seemed to be that initializing my repo and installing my instance locally lead to build errors when I'd sync to Github. Additionally, though gh-pages adds some bells and whistles to will make your first-time Jekyll experience painless (as if there's any pain in working with Jekyll in the first place), this repo is not essential to getting your Github Pages site off the ground. In fact, you don't even need to install Jekyll locally in order to get your Github Pages site running.

Nirvana came to me in the form of an alternate tutorial courtesy of Johnathan McGlone titled "[Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)". Not only does Johnathan take you through the basics of what Git and Github are all about, he instructs you in crafting and serving basic HTML via Github Pages before helping you build the skeleton of your Jekyll instance, taking you through the necessity of each directory and file involved in the process. This not only helped me get a better sense of where Jekyll expects specific files to be, but it allows you to hit the ground running with slicing up your Jekyll content and gives some direction in some next steps for further customization. I have to hand it to Johnathan, his tutorial was easy to follow and didn't rely on branching someone else's work, code which I have no context nor need for, and left me with the one thing I was looking forward to throughout this process: a minimal base of a Jekyll site from which I can start to modify and build out my own site.
