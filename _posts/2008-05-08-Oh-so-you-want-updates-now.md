Hah, yeah, well

The perfect storm of distraction has struck. My *slight* decline in productivity over the last few weeks has been due to finally upgrading to a contemporary laptop (a nice new [Thinkpad T61p](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T61p)), on which I can now run, and subsequently play, a great deal of Half-Life 2 Ep. 2, Team Fortress 2, Crysis, and Assassin's Creed.

Oh, and I've also wading through the muck that is final exams week. My final final exams week in fact. My final final exam is tomorrow evening, the conclusion of which will mark the end of my undergraduate college experience (assuming I pass!), so you might be able to say I’ve had a lot on my plate the last few weeks.

Expect some big updates to the site soon. I've been experimenting with a few web design ideas and I’ve almost finished adding all my portfolio content, so I’ll be moving on to bigger and better sections in the very near future. Lots of big changes happening on my end too. Should be an interesting rest of the month!
