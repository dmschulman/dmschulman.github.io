[It's All Politics](https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/) is a dry show full of obscure references. Hosts Ken Rudin and Ron Elving are another reason why this is one of my favorite programs to listen to on NPR (but only on Thursdays). Looking for a witty and funny way to spend thirty minutes of your life? Especially if you know a thing or two about politics or US history, you should tune into Itâ€™s All Politics.

With a new set of House members swearing in to the 112th United States Congress, IAP has no shortage of points to talk (very quickly) about. As an added bonus, the change over of staff over at the White House as well as a mention of legendary Chicago politician Bill Daley made for some interesting conversation in this most recent episode of [Political Junkie](https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2011/01/07/132739507/this-weeks-podcast-a-new-congress-but-sadly-the-same-old-jokes).

Listen away!
