Quoted from [I Wanna Be The Guy: The Movie: The Game](http://kayin.pyoko.org/iwbtg/index.php):

> This game is very hard. You could find that getting past the very first few screens is taking you the better part of an hour, or more. Do not be deterred. Its supposed to be unfair. Realize this before all else; any and all situations can kill without warning. Take nothing for granted. If it appears safe; you can be nearly certain that it is a trap. Understand that you can only get hit once before you die in a particularly gruesome manner. Be careful!

> If you find yourself becoming sloppy calm down, take a deep breathe, and either continue on or stop playing for awhile. You may just be worn out. Often times you'll find nearly impossible situations are a lot easier when you’ve had a nights sleep.

> In the end, you can at least take heart that save points can be frequently encountered. It is just about the only solace you shall have on your quest to become The Guy.

Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe the difficulty level of this game. Stitched together from pieces of old 8-bit platformer games, I Wanna Be the Guy mischievously takes the most challenging parts from every video game you’ve ever encountered and stitches them back to back to back. Major props on the Megaman intro and all of the throwback music though.
