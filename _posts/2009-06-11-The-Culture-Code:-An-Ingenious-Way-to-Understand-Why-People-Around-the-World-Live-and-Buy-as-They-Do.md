I'm starting a new book today called '[The Culture Code: An Ingenious Way to Understand Why People Around the World Live and Buy as They Do](https://amzn.to/2vCgW6s)’ by Clotaire Rapaille. As someone who has always admired product marketing, well, good product marketing, and appreciates the diversity of cultures view throughout the world, I’m curious to learn more about how these cultural forces shape our feelings about commerce.
