I've been getting this question a lot recently, and for good reason too (I did just move here from the other side of the country), but the fact of the matter is that I don’t really know how to respond.

Ok ok, so if we're talking about this on a macroeconomic scale, I live in the San Fernando Valley (easy enough to identify on a map, right?) and, according to my mailing address I live in Winnetka (Winn-et-ka? Winnet-ka? I still have some problems figuring how to say this word), but saying you live in Winnetka in the San Fernando Valley is like saying you live in Gowanus in Brooklyn, NY. Pretty much no one knows what the fuck you’re talking about.

Therefore, I need to start referring to my area in relation to the other parts of the Valley with which offer some degree of name recognition, but even then I'm at a loss. Winnetka borders Reseda, Woodland Hills, Chatsworth, Northridge, and Canoga Park but even then many people (and Google Maps) still consider it to be part of Encino. I guess in that case I live in Encino? California is way too complicated.

I'm just thankful I don’t live in Northridge. That is all.
