On the unending quest to find brand new internet places to distract myself with every five minutes, I've come across or been told about a few points of interest I thought I would share. There’s a site for every season, but when I go to seek out content or find something to read I like to have one of two (or preferably two) things happen: I laugh or I get informed. [Gawker](http://gawker.com/) does a good job of this, but I’ve recently been supplementing my lowbrow diet with the following sites:

* [Nature](https://www.nature.com/)

* [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/)

* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)

* [Give Me Something to Read](http://givemesomethingtoread.com/)

* [Longform.org](https://longform.org/)

* [Dangerous Minds](https://dangerousminds.net/)
