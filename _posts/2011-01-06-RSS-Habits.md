I read a lot of websites. Generally I prefer to go to those websites to get my information fix, but I've also been looking into utilizing RSS feeds so I can more easily access my favorite sites across multiple web platforms. This usage is especially interesting to me now that I own a tablet computer and am looking to develop some programs that take advantage of different protocols like RSS for displaying content.

[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) is the best way I've found to manage RSS feeds and sort them into appropriate groups, but I never liked their web design. Plus the ability to locally store the hundreds of stories I browse everyday is pretty damn useful. For this reason, I like using a local client. [FeedDemon](http://www.feeddemon.com/) on Windows 7 is what I have running right now and Iâ€™m enjoying the experience so far. However, setting up a new RSS reader that easily syncs with Google Reader has forced me to go back through my old RSS feeds and clean out some junk.

I consume a HUGE amount of content online and it changes on a frequent basis. Android apps like [Google Listen](http://listen.googlelabs.com/), which I use for syncing podcasts, have enhanced my RSS library by allowing me to add feeds for my favorite shows and podcasts directly to Google Reader. Now I've got articles, audio, and sometimes video available to me on the go.

Even though I intend to keep growing this list, I felt the need to capture what I'm currently browsing via RSS here. Feeds have been conveniently categorized below, though I am always working to refine how my streams are sorted. Presented, for your viewing pleasure, my huge list of feeds:
