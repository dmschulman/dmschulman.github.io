Praise the lord for [StumbleUpon](https://www.stumbleupon.com/). Besides being an excellently interesting way to waste my time all most every day, it has also introduced me to some really fantastic websites. I will tell you about one of them now, I will.

[Inspiredology.com](https://inspiredology.com/) is the graphic design blog of Chad Mueller, a designer himself who posts lists of his favorite media designs, [cd covers](http://inspiredology.com/graphic-design/99-best-designed-album-covers/#more-91), [photo heavy websites](http://inspiredology.com/graphic-design/40-photo-enhanced-websites/), and [concert posters](http://inspiredology.com/graphic-design/part-1-125-concert-posters/) for others to take in and appreciate. I've only had time to glance through the concert posters entry, but Iâ€™ve been impressed by a lot of the content already and will anxiously await more updates as the site grows (his blog is only a month or so old, mind you).
