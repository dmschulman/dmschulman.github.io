What's in a bag? Stuff, generally, but on a deeper more philosophical level, what makes a particular bag good at what it does versus every other bags out there in the world today? They’re all just a pouch with zippers and straps on the back, right? Well, if you travel enough, you’re probably on the same page as me when it comes to hauling your things from point A to point B (and all points beyond). Nothing can take away from the fun and excitement of exploring a new destination more than the feeling of exhaustion and pain that can come from lugging around a heavy suitcase or uncomfortable bag everywhere you go. 

And what about the amount of stuff a bag allows you to take with? My philosophy when it comes to travel is to pack light but to still bring enough to keep me comfortable and happy no matter what the destination. Packing too much not only leads to bearing more weight (and wearing out your patience) but it also leads to having less time immersed in your destination (whether it be constantly having to repack your bag or the extra decision making time involved in having exponentially more items at your disposal). Travel enough and the benefits of a travel philosophy like [Onebagging](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/) or [Ultralite Packing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/) will start to become apparent very quickly.

You can read a little more about my essential carry when traveling, my take on Onebag travel, and my thoughts on just how many bags a person really needs in life (the answer is 3), but in this ongoing post I will be sharing my experience with searching for and trying to find the perfect travel bag for my needs. With an upcoming international trip to Iceland this fall and week long trip this past spring to San Francisco (during with my rolltop bag failed to live up to the goal of making my life easier), my brain has been hard at work wrestling over the question of which travel bag out there is just the right one for my needs. Being that I travel relatively light and prefer to carry ALL my belongings in a single carry-on bag, my perfect travel pack would possess all of the following features:

* 20-35L in capacity that meets airline carry-on size regulations

* Multiple carry options (I'd primarily use it as a backpack but comfortable side handles and shoulder strap options would be desired)

* Made from durable and waterproof materials, assembled in a quality fashion

* Speaking of fashion, the bag should look sleek, modern, and professional

* No unnecessary hip pads, extra straps, or other accessories hanging from the bag

* Lots of pockets, but not too many pockets

* An affordable price point

Functionality is key, but I'm also focused on finding something that looks good and holds up just as well as it works. Fortunately for me, there seems to have been an explosion of quality bag manufacturers over the last 10 years or so churning out thoughtful and well designed products for every category of traveler. However, reading up on reviews and watching countless Youtube videos can only yield so much information. If I was really invested in this search I’d have to actually, you know, invest in a bag or two and see for myself just what works. So on that note, you will find a series of quick reviews below for each bag I’ve tested in this search. Bags that didn’t make the cut have been noted, this doesn’t mean the bag sucked necessarily (if I spent money on it chances are I took my time and did my research), but for my specific needs while traveling, and partially due to my desire to not own a ton of bags I’ll never use, I’ve moved on to other products.

### [Mission Workshop Sanction](https://missionworkshop.com/collections/backpacks/products/the-sanction-rucksack-backpack)

**Capacity:** 20L, **Dimensions:** 12" x 18" x 5"

**Style:** Top loading backpack, **Laptop:** 15"

**Materials:** 1000D Nylon, **Weight:** 2.6lbs

**Price:** $205, **Color:** Charcoal

**Likes:** Very stylish, quality materials and construction, inventive pocket configuration (but only for narrow items), minimal velcro, comfortable shoulder straps.

**Dislikes:** 20L isn't enough space for a week long trip. Top loading means a lot of repacking and fishing for items, plastic clips might break eventually, can only carry as backpack.

**Verdict:** Sturdy and stylish pack that will make for a good backup bag, but with its top loading construction, not ideal for long excursions.
