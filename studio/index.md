<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Welcome my constantly changing, ever evolving bedroom music studio. Here you will find a wealth of resources related to synthesizers, mixers, effects, electronic music production, studio tips, and sage advice from someone who has and continues to find new ways to organize their music making equipment. Alongside information about the gear I currently use, I will be hosting in-depth pages about specific instruments (complete with patches, controller templates, manuals, and other collected bits), as well as other articles and columns related to my production style and my take on building my personal studio.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and some music too.</p>
