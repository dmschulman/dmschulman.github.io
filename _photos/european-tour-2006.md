description: "It was hard to resist taking small trips here and there while I was studying abroad for a year in England. Most of the time I only had a short weekend to myself, but during my fall break from classes I set out on a solo adventure to see more of the European mainland. My trip took me from the shores of France (via a ferry from Dover) to my first stop, the city of Bruges in Belgium. I lost myself among the medieval architecture and varieties of flavored beer, almost narrowly missing the bus to my next destination: Amsterdam. My journey would continue through Berlin, where I visited the Olympic stadium among other destinations, and finally ended in the old world city of Prague."
