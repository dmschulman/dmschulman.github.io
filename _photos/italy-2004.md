description: "In the summer of 2004 I took my first trip abroad to visit the sites in and around Italy. My dad and I flew first to Rome, then traveled to The Vatican, drove to Florence and the coastal city of Manarola in the Cinque Terre region, and made a final pit stop in a little town called Pisa."
