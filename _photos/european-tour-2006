description: "It was hard to resist taking small trips here and there while I was studying abroad in England. The majority of these excursions were only for short weekends, but over fall break in 2006 I expanded my horizons and traveled deeper into Europe. My solo adventure started on a ferry to Calais, France and then continued via bus to the city of Bruges and through to Amsterdam. After getting a through dose of Belgian and Dutch culture I made my way to Centraal Station and traveled 7 hours by train to experience Berlin, Germany before making my way to Prague, final leg of my journey."
