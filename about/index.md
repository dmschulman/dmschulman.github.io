Hey there, my name is David Michael Schulman. I’m a front-end web developer currently based out of Philadelphia, PA. I admire minimal, lightweight, and well-designed web applications, endeavoring to incorporate those values into every project that comes across my desk. Currently I lead full-stack development at [University of the Sciences](https://www.usciences.edu/index.html), maintaining and evolving the university's online presence across all public-facing, admission-focused websites and applications.

Web development and design has been a devotion of mine as far back as I can remember. With humble beginnings on Geocities (my first ever website was about the game [Unreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_(1998_video_game))!) and bare HTML, I dabbled and experimented with my own websites that resembled the graphic and print layouts I grew up admiring moreso than they did any hypetext document (thanks for the inspiration, [Phaidon Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaidon_Press)). In many ways I credit [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/) and even [Superbad.com](http://superbad.com/) for showing me very early on what was possible with a medium such as the web.

<!-- ## My background

Being an early adopter of the roll-your-own blogging platform [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress), I stood up my first LAMP stack in 2005 which allowed me to cut my teeth on a new framework involving PHP and MySQL.
