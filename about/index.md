Hey there. My name is David Schulman and I’m a front-end web developer currently based out of Philadelphia, PA. I admire minimal, lightweight, and well-designed web applications, endeavoring to incorporate those values into every project that comes across my desk. Currently I lead full stack development on the website of [University of the Sciences](https://www.usciences.edu/index.html).
