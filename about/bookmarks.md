This page contains a lengthy list of web bookmarks I've collected over the years. These links have been painstakingly catalogued here for [posterity’s sake](https://dmschulman.com/bookmark-no-more/), I will do my best to maintain these lists but I make no guarantees that any of the items here are immune from [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot). Some of these sites you will know, but many, I anticipate, you will not. I hope you’ll have as much fun and enjoyment exploring these sites as I did when I first stumbled on them.
