title: "USciences Online"
description: "Online education presents a unique opportunity for traditional brick-and-mortar universities, especially established schools like USciences who have made a name for themselves in higher education over the last two centuries. The university had dabbled in online courses in the past, but when a new push was initiated in 2019 to create degree-granting online programs for graduate and undergraduate students it was imperative to quickly establish a digital presence which would allow the university to promote the new initiative as well as attract and enroll online learners."
