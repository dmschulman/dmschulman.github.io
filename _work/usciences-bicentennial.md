title: "USciences Bicentennial"
description: "Being the first college of pharmacy in the nation, University of the Sciences (established in 1821) has a lot to be proud of in its 200 years of educating leaders in science and healthcare. To celebrate this milestone, a series of events, lectures, fundraising campaigns, class reunions, and other festivities were planned for the 2020-2021 academic year. To help promote and communicate the Bicentennial and build excitement around the event it was determined a microsite would need to be built within our existing CMS allowing the university to promote the event and its storied past to the public."

<!-- ## Challenges

The story of University of the Sciences is a complex one with multiple facets to present, highly dependent on images and visual materials pulled from the unversity archives. Presenting this material within our normal site templates was not an option, but creating a separate web presence was beyond the scope and timeline of what we needed to accomplish. A unique solution had to be designed and coded within our existing content management system, and one that would work well and load quickly for our majority mobile audience. After content was finalized it was decided that building a microsite would be the only way to achieve the inspirational tone and forward-thinking design the project required.

It was necessary that the design of the microsite incorporate some flexibility as the campaign would evolve throughout the 2021 and 2022 academic years and new content would need to be included, no matter the format. The microsite would additionally need to deliver an image-heavy presentation though be nimble enough to load quickly on a mobile phone. A balance between immersive visual design and clever coding would need to be established in order to deliver on spec and within the confines of our CMS.
