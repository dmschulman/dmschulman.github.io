artist: "Porter Vance"
description: "This riff kind of reminds me of 'Steppin' Out' by Joe Jackson. Scrolling through the default presets on the MB-6582 8x SID chip synth monster I've finally finished building. Warning: some unexpected loud bits (though really who doesn't love it loud and unexpected?)"
